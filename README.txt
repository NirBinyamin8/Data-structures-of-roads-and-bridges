The purpose of the exercise:
C++ implementation of an abstract data type that contains data about roads and bridges as described below.
Two cities A and B are given and between them there are m parallel roads (not intersecting), numbered from 1 to m. During
The time bridges are built on the roads, when there can be any (unlimited) number of bridges on each road,
And the height of any bridge can be any positive real number.

Input and output: the program will receive as input the number of roads m between cities A and B.
In a separate line, the program will receive the number of operations to be performed, n, and then, in each line, the
The operation with parameters if necessary depending on the operation
